This code performs linear regression to predict car selling prices based on various features. It uploads and reads a CSV file, preprocesses the data by checking for null values and encoding categorical variables, then splits the dataset into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is trained and its performance evaluated using the R-squared metric. Finally, the model predicts the selling price of a car using sample input data.
